# Sales Data Analysis and Reporting for a Retail Chain

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data analysis on retail transaction and customer response data using Python, SQL, and Excel. The project aims to clean, analyze, and visualize data to uncover trends in sales performance and customer behavior, and to support strategic decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/Yamini442/sales-data-analysis-retail/blob/main/Retail_data_transactions.csv">transactions data</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Yamini442/sales-data-analysis-retail/blob/main/Retail_data_response.csv">response data</a>

## Tools used
SQL ,
Python(Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib),
Excel.

## Questions / KPIs 
The analysis focused on the following business questions and performance indicators :
- What are the monthly sales trends over the observed period?
- How many transactions occur each month, and how does total spending vary?
- What is the response rate to marketing campaigns across different months?
- Who are the top-spending customers?
- Are there any observable patterns or correlations between transaction volume and customer response?

- Dashboard Interaction

 - <a href = "https://github.com/Yamini442/sales-data-analysis-retail/blob/main/AddAnlys_Dashboard.png">AddAnlys dashboard</a>

## Process
The project was executed in three phases:
1. Data Preparation:
   - Loaded data using SQL and verified schema structure.
   - Cleaned and merged datasets using Python (Pandas).
2. RFM Analysis:
   - Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
   - Applied segmentation rules to classify customers into P0, P1, and P2.
3. Visualization:
   - Built Excel dashboards to display sales trends, customer segmentation, and response analysis.

## Project Insights
- Identified customers with the highest total transaction amounts.
- Determined average transaction values across customer segments.
- Discovered that certain transaction patterns correlate with positive marketing responses.
- P0 segment represents high-value customers with recent, frequent, and high-volume purchases.
- Found outliers and anomalies in transaction behavior, useful for fraud checks or special marketing attention.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how SQL, Python, and Excel can be combined effectively for end-to-end data analysis. SQL ensured structured data setup and querying, Python offered scalable and efficient analysis workflows, and Excel enabled clear and compelling reporting. This approach is applicable to many real-world business analysis cases, especially in retail or customer data domains.
